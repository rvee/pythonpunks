## Shared space for Python Exercises & Solutions

**What's this about ?**

Anyone can contribute resources like exercises, learning materials & sources here. Contribute to the solution & share their individual code.

**How it works ?**

* *Exercises* : We have a folder with different verticals which targets on the different types of the problems or specific topic of the language itself along with its labels of begginer/intermediate/advanced.
* *Solutions* : Solutions submitted by individuals should have a statndard file/folder name with excercise number underscore individual name
* *Best Solution* : one best solution for the problem & can be modified if someone come up with cool way of solving it.
* *Resources* : Bunch of preferred resources to be followed.



### Standards of each solution submitted by the individual

Example:
```
